This toolbelt aims to be a standard operator container image with useful tools and an operations guide for gardener landscapes pre-installed. The images built with the ops-toolbelt dockerfiles are used from within the Gardener Dashboard web consoles into the garden, seed, or shoot clusters, both as general pod and as node-bound pod (behaving as if being on the node directly; requires a running Kubelet and healthy control plane, a working VPN connection, and sufficient capacity on the node)
